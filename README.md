# Predicting Student Outcomes Using GitLab Activity

This project was developed for the **Data Science and Engineering Project (PECD)** course, as part of the Bachelor's in Engineering and Data Science at the University of Coimbra.

## About The Project

The main goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the academic performance of students in a software engineering course. The prediction is based on an analysis of their activity in GitLab repositories, which serves as a proxy for measuring their engagement, productivity, and collaborative work patterns.

The project aims not only to create a predictive model but also to provide a simple user interface to demonstrate its results. This allows instructors to identify students who may need additional support early on.
