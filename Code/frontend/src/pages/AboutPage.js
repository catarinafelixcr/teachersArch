        <h2>About the Project</h2>

        <p>
          This site was created by a team of students from the <strong>Bachelor in Engineering and Data Science</strong> at the University of Coimbra ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's part of the PECD course project, aiming to help teachers understand and predict student performance based on GitLab activity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built with React, Django, DRF, PostgreSQL, and too much caffeine.
        </p>
